* The api used to create the app was the cocktail API.

* The app is made to have a simple function of searching for easy cocktail ideas using the name of a drink or what ingredients you want ot use in a drink such as liquor type. This requires users to create a log in for the future feature of adding specific drinks to your favorites and a place to add your own drinks and recipes. 

* The following was used to make this possible.
1. Flask
2. Python
3. WTForms
4. SQLAlechemy
5. Flask Bcrypt (for passwork saftey.)
